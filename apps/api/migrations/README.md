## Usage

### Run Migration (Populate Database)
```bash
npm run migrate
```

### Check Migration Status
```bash
npm run migrate:status
```

### Rollback Migration (Remove Fake Data)
```bash
npm run migrate:down
```

## Configuration

The migration uses the configuration from `migrate-mongo-config.js`:
- Database: `jcd`
- Connection: Uses `MONGODB_URI` from `.env` or defaults to `mongodb://localhost:27017`

## Data Characteristics

- All emails are unique and generated from names
- Phone numbers are randomly generated
- Hire dates range across the past 10 years
- Evaluation dates are within the past 2 years
- All scores are realistic (1.0-5.0 with 2 decimal places)
- 70% of evaluations include feedback comments
- Department assignments are logical (teaching staff to academic depts, non-teaching to admin depts)

## Collections Modified

The migration affects these MongoDB collections:
- `roles` - User roles and permissions
- `departments` - Academic and administrative departments
- `personnels` - Teaching and non-teaching staff
- `users` - System users with authentication
- `performanceevaluations` - Teaching staff evaluations
- `nonteachingevaluations` - Non-teaching staff evaluations
- `evaluationforms` - Evaluation templates and forms

## Notes

- Running the migration multiple times will create duplicate data (not idempotent)
- To reset, run `npm run migrate:down` then `npm run migrate` again
- All ObjectId references are properly linked between collections
- Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) are automatically generated
